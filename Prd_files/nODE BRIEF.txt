First Stage: Node databases
Project Name: Travel Tech Node Registry

Owner: IOL Product & Partnerships Team

Status: Draft

1. Overview
IOL operates as a network-of-networks in the travel technology space, facilitating connectivity between supply systems (PMS, CRS, CM) and demand partners (OTAs, GDS, Metasearch, etc.). Many of our partners offer multiple products under a single brand, each playing a different role in the connectivity ecosystem.
This project introduces a structured data model and system for classifying, tagging, and tracking each functional node across the partner ecosystem. The registry enables accurate mapping, integration planning, performance tracking, and strategic prioritization.

2. Purpose
* To standardize how travel tech systems are categorized within IOL’s integration and connectivity landscape
* To support accurate visualization of supply and demand connectivity
* To decouple entities (companies) from the systems (nodes) they operate
* To prepare for dynamic tiering, network analytics, and partner performance intelligence
* To enable automated tools (graph APIs, dashboards, partner insights)

3. Scope
This project includes:
* A structured data model for all nodes in the ecosystem
* A centralized registry of Node Instances (e.g., Cloudbeds CM, SynXis CRS)
* Classification fields such as category, direction, supported protocols, and data types
* Foundation for visual mapping, monitoring, and analytics tools

4. Definitions
* Entity: A company or provider (e.g., Cloudbeds, D-Edge) 
* Node: A specific product/system operated by the entity (e.g., Cloudbeds CM)
* Node Category: Functional role the node plays in the travel tech ecosystem (e.g., CRS, PMS, CM)
* Direction: Whether the node acts as a source (Supply), destination (Demand), intermediary (Switch), or hybrid

5. Data Model
Each Node record will include the following fields:
